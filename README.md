# Mazes

We focus on the following three algorithms:
(a) A 20 by 20 rectangular maze.
(b) A 20 by 20 hexagon maze.
(c) A 20 by 20 rectangular maze with 2 tunnels, with tunnel entry points drawn in coloured squares.

Five classes completed by our team are: 
RecursiveBacktrackerGenerator.java, GrowingTreeGenerator.java, ModifiedPrimsGenerator.java, BiDirectionalRecursiveBacktrackerSolver.java, WallFollowerSolver.java
